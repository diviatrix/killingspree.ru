    <h2>A Peaceful Island Adventure</h2>
        
        <p>In <strong>Islands MP</strong>, you're left to explore a peaceful island after an old, rusty ship tosses you overboard. Survival is simpleâ€”you have the tools and skills to manage. The real challenge lies in the journey of discovery, building, and creating a new life in a relaxing world.</p>
    
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relaxed Exploration:</strong> Move easily with smooth controls and enjoy a calm, open world where you can take things at your own pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Settle & Build:</strong> Start by finding or crafting a shelter with the tools you have. Build your home and expand as you gather resources you need.</li>
            <li><strong>Experience & Achieve:</strong> The focus isn't on difficult bosses or intense challenges, but on the joy of creating, exploring, and unlocking achievements through progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Meet & Connect:</strong> Encounter NPCs, roleplay stories, and connect with other players. Play solo or with friends on self-hosted or public server, chatting and building tiny community.</li>
            <li><strong>Grow & Explore:</strong> Expand your island, discover surrounding lands, and enjoy a cozy, retro-tech fantasy world full of wonder and calm.</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>This game is about taking your time, finding joy in the little things, and shaping your experience in a peaceful, rewarding way.</p>
